    "## Problem description\n",
    "\n",
    "The need arises in the context of an **automatic speech recognition*** and transcription system (ASR for short) used in the medical domain. The transcriptions currently contain a number of errors big enough to be problematic, most likely due to the significant disparity between the **target domain (healthcare)** and the domain composition of the datasets used for training the base ASR system (most likely not focused exclusively on healthcare).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to improve the ASR's performance, these errors should be detected, so that they can be characterized, the effort of fixing them can then be adequately quantified, the impact and trade-off of doing so can thus be estimated (so that each error type can be prioritized effectively) and, finally, so that corrected versions of the ideal transcription can be produced (and added as regression tests and/or further training data to mitigate the model's underfitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "The core task of transcription error detection can be framed, to at least some extent, as the more general **spellcehcking/error detection** task. Our proposed solution in this spirit is outlined throughout the rest of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's worth also noting that a purely binary objective function (_error_ or _no error_) would not be optimal in our case, though, as not all errors are equally damaging for the proper understanding of a transcription (more damaging errors should be assigning higher scores, and prioritized accordingly) and, similarly, not all transcriptions contain the same amount of errors (we'd expect transcriptions containing many errors to be ranked higher than those containing fewer errors). Ideally, this objective calls for a probabilistic score that can reflect these quantitative nuances.\n",
    "\n",
    "This becomes particularly more important in the context of an annotation task where a limited-size team of annotators is required to annotate as effectively as possible within a constrained annotation budget in terms of person hours. In order to scale the annotation process and ensure that the annotators, whichever their number, can be as productive as possible, we should have them look at samples with a higher error density first, in order to highlight recurrent patterns and/or particularly serious ASR errors."

    "## Proposed solution\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the domain relevance of the prototype presented here, we leverage the English translation of the [CodiEsp corpus](https://zenodo.org/records/3693570#.X3rm8C8RrOR) of clinical cases (general medicine) as our **dataset**. File `src/codiesp.py` contains the Python data loaders for the dataset and exposes as constants two pandas DataFrames (`CODIESP`, `TEST`) with the expected data schema. Please note that this module presupposes the existence of the sibling folder `data`, under which the CodiEsp dataset raw data files must have been placed:\n",
